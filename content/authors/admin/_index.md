I am Md. Motahar Mahtab, an AI Engineer with 2.5 years of industry experience in building state-of-the-art ML models with a solid academic background and hands-on experience in the tech sector. I graduated from BRAC University with a CGPA of 3.99 in Computer Science & Engineering. Currently, I am currently working at Delineate Inc., where I have worked on medical data extraction from Quantitive Systems Pharmacology papers using GPT4o in multi-agent pipelines. Previously, I was with Giga Tech Ltd., developing systems for various Bangla NLP tasks, creating REST APIs using FastAPI, optimizing ML models with Nvidia TensorRT, and deploying these models on the Nvidia Triton Inference Server for efficient inference.

My technical skill set includes ML libraries (like PyTorch, Huggingface, LangChain), web frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI, Streamlit), and tools for ML optimization and deployment (such as Triton, Dask, and MLflow).
